# Can of Books FrontEnd

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Overview
For this assignment, you will READ book data by connecting your front-end React app to a back-end Express server. Your Express server will connect to a MongoDB database. You will need to make a “schema” in your back-end code to model how you want your data to look. You will then populate your database with “seed” data—some of your favorite books. When the front end makes a request to your server, your server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Your front end will display these results.
